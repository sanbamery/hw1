            <h2><span class="item-number">1.</span> <span class="title">Italian soda at Bytes</span></h2>
            <a href="#">Bytes Cafe</a>
            <p class="paragraphs"> When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend because she had been craving something sweet and refreshing for a few weeks. Bytes is a casual eatery that sells quick and easy food. They can whip up some great Italian sodas by mixing some flavored syrup and carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask, I honestly don't remember because my friend ordered this one for me). Overall, great tasting and refreshing, but it does leave a fizzy aftertaste.</p>
            <p><span class="recommendation">Recommendation:</span> Raspberry Italian Soda </p>

         <h2><span class="item-number">2.</span> <span class="title"> tea at Pop Tea Bar </span></h2>
         <a href="#">Pop Tea Bar</a>
            
            <p class="paragraphs">When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge Ave, a short walk from campus (about 0.3 miles). They have some great drinks that are perfect for a warm spring day. Their tea is of high quality and the boba is soft, chewy, and sweet, which is essential. They have little bite-sized food options (like vegetable egg rolls and snack-size portions). They also have indoor seating, but they have a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.</p>
            <p><span class="recommendation">Recommendation:</span> Classic Milk Tea and Lattes - any flavor of popping boba!</p>

         <h2><span class="item-number">3.</span> <span class="title"> at CoHo </span></h2>
<a href="#">Coupa Cafe</a>
            
<p class="paragraphs">CoHo, a popular student hangout, has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've seen that has it on campus (and I love my vanilla). I'm not exactly sure what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.</p>


<p><span class="recommendation">Recommendation:</span> Vanilla Bean Latte</p>

         <h2><span class="item-number">4.</span> <span class="title"> Agua Fresca at Nexus Cafe</span></h2>
         

<p class="paragraphs">If you're looking for an alternative to water and tea, Agua Fresca is something you should seek out. It's a soft, fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to enjoy the warm weather with a refreshing drink. The cafe is a little pricey, but it's great for a special occasion.</p>

<p><span class="recommendation">Recommendation:</span> Agua Fresca</p>
